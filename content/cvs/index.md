#### _There seems to be an obvious divide between how people prefer to receive CVs and resumes. In an attempt to satisfy the majority, I have added both a single page resume and a multi-page for convenience._ 

* [Single-page condensed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Mb8jg88JzGnEG2N01cfKZ9rDtfvwJz7/view?usp=sharing)
* [Multi-page with summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rkHPR3vYcY0GISDGqeGRLKc74uYhqG0d/view?usp=sharing)

#### _Since I find it difficult to highlight more soft skills, workplace compatibility and values in a resume, I've made a less technical one to reflect these traits_

* _Coming Soon_
