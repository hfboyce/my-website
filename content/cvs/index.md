#### _There seems to be an obvious divide between how people prefer to receive CVs and resumes. In an attempt to satisfy the majority, I have added both a single page resume and a multi-page for convinience._ 

* [Single-page condensed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14twqi-f5mbY-up6j7VyVzTZN26xP3y1W/view?usp=sharing)
* [Multi-page with summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y0CT_Bw55KT9uGUhNlIYKA7k9pwVw5os/view?usp=sharing)

#### _Since I find it dificult to highlight more softskills, workplace compatibilty and values I've made a less technical resume to reflect these traits_

* coming soon
