I am a Vancouver born, outdoor, baking and data enthusiast.  Growing up in a French immersion atmosphere, I gravitated towards numbers and mathematics due to their versatile and universal application in all languages. This led me to complete a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Western Ontario from the Applied Mathematics department. I developed a passion for analytics through work experience which influenced my decision to persue a Master of Data Science.  I love creating new things, be it a new machine learning model, or a new recipe.
