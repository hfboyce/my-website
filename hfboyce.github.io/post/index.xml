      <description>What makes a Good Explanation Today in My DSCI 542- Communication and Argumentation class we discussed what made a good explanation. What is a top down approach vs. what is a bottom up approach? Where should we start? What examples are good examples? Something that was never brought to my attention is how powerful the &amp;ldquo;curse of knowledge&amp;rdquo; is when it comes to making a quality explanation. Sometimes when we understand something so well we seem to jump straight to examples and language that is familiar to us, but not for the person on the receiving end.</description>
